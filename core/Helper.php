     * Dump the entity of a Doctrine entity. This method is cleaner

     * Lazy load proxies always contain an instance of Doctrineâ€™s
     * EntityManager and all its dependencies. Therefore a var_dump()
     * will possibly dump a very large recursive structure which is impossible
     * to render and read. You have to use Doctrine\Common\Util\Debug::dump()
     * to restrict the dumping to a human readable level. Additionally you
     * should be aware that dumping the EntityManager to a Browser may take
     * several minutes, and the Debug::dump() method just ignores any
     * occurrences of it in Proxy instances.
